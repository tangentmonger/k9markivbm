=== USB permissions ===

Problem: mod_usbhid.py fails with:
fruitfly[3343] ERROR usbhid poll crashed: USBError(13, 'Access denied (insufficient permissions)') (next run delayed by 5.00s)

Solution:
* create udev rules file:
sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/1-flexible-keyboard.rules

* add rule to file:
ATTRS{idVendor}=="0e6a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"

* check that user k9 is in plugdev group 
id
sudo vim /etc/group

* reload udev rules
udevadm trigger
and/or replug keyboard

* check ownership of keyboard:
ls -al /dev/bus/usb/001/
(should be one usable by plugdev group)
